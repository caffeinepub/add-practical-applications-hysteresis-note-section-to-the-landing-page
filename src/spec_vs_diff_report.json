The diff also includes unrelated configuration/metadata changes not requested by REQ-5.",

      "reason": "The diff summary reports \"Added: 0\" and lists no added files, so the addition of the actual JPEG cannot be confirmed from the diff itself (even though `frontend-file-summaries.txt` mentions an asset path).",

      "reason": "`frontend/src/components/sections/DemoMediaSection.tsx` is not listed among modified files, so there is no evidence in the diff summary that placeholder logic/rendering behavior was updated.",
