  "summary": "The diff does not add or update any frontend static image assets or relevant frontend code/config. Only `project_state.json` was modified, so REQ-10 is not implemented in the provided changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Add the newly uploaded image to `frontend/public/assets/whatsapp-image-2026-02-06-092349.jpeg` (via rename/copy if needed) and ensure the Demo & Media section loads it correctly in production by matching the path referenced by `frontend/src/siteConfig.ts` (or updating the config to the shipped filename).",
      "reason": "No new files were added (including the required JPEG under `frontend/public/assets/`), and no changes to `frontend/src/siteConfig.ts` or `frontend/src/components/sections/DemoMediaSection.tsx` are present in the diff summary.",
