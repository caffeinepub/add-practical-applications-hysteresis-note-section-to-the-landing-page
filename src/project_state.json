    "Frontend uses generated Candid bindings and an actor creation hook to call the Motoko backend.",
    "Authentication is designed around Internet Identity; unauthenticated vs authenticated actor usage is encapsulated in hooks/utilities.",
    "UI layer is built with Tailwind and bundled shadcn/ui components for consistent design system primitives.",
    "Landing page content is organized as discrete section components, allowing additional documentation-style sections (e.g., manual/code/diagrams) to be added without restructuring the overall app shell."
